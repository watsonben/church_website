NEW WEBSITE STUFF :D :D :D
====================================================================================================

So I got a little bored and decided to procrastinate my assignment and quickly whipped up a little
model of what I reckon the new website could look like :D to run it, just click run the index.html
file (either from command line or by double clicking it :D) and you should be good to go! it's very
Bootstrap-ey but I kinda like it xD

Ummmmmm what else? Oh, yeah, the pictures are shockingly generic so maybe get someone to take actual
good high quality photos and replace them, they're in the img folder. 

Should be pretty self-explanatory, if anything goes wrong email me.
